# Minos

Minos is a shape-stacking game in the spirit of Tetris®. You can choose your starting level, which affects how quickly blocks drop at the beginning of the game.

Shapes begin at the top of the well. Use the left, right, and down buttons to move the shapes within the well. Up will rotate the shape. Pressing the A button will activate auto-drop, which causes the shape to fall rapidly to the bottom of the well. Filled lines will clear, and shapes drop more quickly as you clear lines and level-up. The game continues until a shape cannot be dropped from the top of the well.
